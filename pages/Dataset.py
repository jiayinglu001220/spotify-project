        These three datasets collectively offer a comprehensive view of the music landscape. The Kaggle dataset
        provides artist name and song name of top 10000 streamed songs in Spotify. By leveraging the Spotify API,
        we can enrich this dataset with additional information such as genre classifications and release date for
        corresponding songs. The music genre website provides a list of broad music category, and under each 
        category including a list of sub-genres (the genre name we retrieved using the Spotify API). Dataset 3 
        essentially provides dictionary style data, where the key is the high level genre(rock) and the value is
        a list of specific genres(revival clang rock, punk rock, etc). I will use the specific genre retrieved from
        Spotify api along with a dictionary to get the corresponding high level genre. Therefore, the 10000 popular
        songs in dataset 1 will only have around 15 genres instead of 6000+ genres, which will provide a more meaningful
        analysis.
