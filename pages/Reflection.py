            The objective of this research project is to systematically analyze the evolution
            of music genre popularity over time, utilizing comprehensive streaming data of the
            top 10000 songs across various genres on Spotify. This analysis seeks to identify 
            patterns and shifts in music consumption preferences, thereby contributing to a nuanced
            understanding of the dynamic landscape of music genres in modern society.

st.header("Findings")
st.write('''
            Genres such as Pop and Hip-Hop have not only seen a significant rise in popularity
            but have also consistently dominated the market followed by R&B and Electronic. 
            Although numerous genres are prevalent in the market, they are not as competitive
            as Hip-Hop and Pop music.

            A noteworthy observation is the pronounced surge in total streams during the late 1990s, 
            coinciding with the introduction and proliferation of MP3 technology and portable music players. 
            This period marked a pivotal shift in how music was consumed, facilitating easier access to
            a wider range of music. The subsequent decade further accelerated this trend with the advent
            of streaming services and broader internet access, drastically enhancing the accessibility and
            convenience of streaming music.

            As digital platforms have grown and evolved, they've really changed the game for how different
            music genres gain popularity, showing just how much technology can influence what we listen to
            and how we connect with culture.

            I encountered challenges while attempting to add multiple pages to my webapp using Streamlit, 
            as it lacks a built-in function for this purpose. Initially, I thought this task would be 
            straightforward. After some research, I managed to create a multi-page application by organizing
            multiple Python files under a specific directory structure. Now, by running just the homepage
            Python file, I can access a fully functional multi-page webapp.

            During the project, I realized the importance of enhancing my visualization skills in Streamlit.
            With a better understanding of its visualization tools and interactive features, I could have
            made my webapp more engaging and user-friendly.

st.header("Look Forward")
st.write('''
            I'm interested in enhancing the visualizations in my webapp, particularly by incorporating an
            interactive global map. Ideally, hovering over a country would display a popup showing the most
            popular music genre in that country. This feature would not only improve the user experience but
            also enrich their understanding of the project's insights.
